### Why does the UI look like Factory Planner?

I originally developed the solver for linear problems as an [additional feature of Factory Planner](https://github.com/ClaudeMetz/FactoryPlanner/pull/25). However, that solver was not merged, so I decided to develop another mod from scratch specifically for that solver.

### Where do I report bugs?

Please report to [Issues on Github](https://github.com/B-head/factory_solver/issues).
